# COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACE PLATFORM

This is a collaborative workspace platform, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [convex](https://www.convex.dev/), and [liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/), following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADJKbuayubE) by [Code with Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio).

The application is deployed on Vercel [here](https://miro-clone-ten.vercel.app/), though it is by invitation only for now.
